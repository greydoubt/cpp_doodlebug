/*
Organism is an abstract base class representing the common behavior of organisms in the Doodle-Bug problem. It declares a pure virtual function move() which needs to be implemented by derived classes (Ant and DoodleBug). The class is templated, allowing flexibility in the type of data associated with each organism.
